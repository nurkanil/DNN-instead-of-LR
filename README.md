# DNN-instead-of-LR for real estate price prediction
This notebook consists of comparison between Linear Regression and Neural Network for a simple house price prediction test
In my opinion, for the dataset including location information like altitude and longtitude It is better to use Neural Network instead of Linear Regression while predicting real estate price.
Even tough we tried Ridge Regression Neural Network resulted better on validation.
